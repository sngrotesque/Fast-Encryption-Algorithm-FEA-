# Fast Encryption Algorithm (FEA)

This is FEA.

The block size of this encryption algorithm is 128 bits, and the key length is 256 bits (unchangeable). Currently, four encryption methods are provided (CBC, ECB, CTR, CFB).

This algorithm has good Avalanche effects.

The number of rounds for encryption (or decryption) is 4.
